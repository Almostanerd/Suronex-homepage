Suronex Homepage:

This is a homepage design for Suronex, built for the Crescentia One internship task. The work is limited to the landing page only.

I didn’t try to make the page flashy or overloaded. Since Suronex is about security and compliance, the design needed to feel calm, reliable, and confident first — not loud.

How I thought about the design:

The first thing I focused on was clarity. When someone lands on the page, they should immediately understand:

what Suronex is

and that it’s a serious product meant for security teams

That’s why the hero section is clean, text-led, and structured. The idea was to let the product speak clearly before adding anything extra.

The rest of the page explains things step by step instead of throwing everything at once. Spacing and typography do most of the work, so the page feels easy to read rather than busy.

Animations & visuals:

Animations are subtle on purpose. They’re there to make the page feel responsive and alive — small movements, hover effects, smooth transitions — not to distract.

Some 3D and animated visuals are used, but only where they add meaning or depth. I avoided putting heavy visuals everywhere so the page stays fast and doesn’t feel overwhelming, especially on mobile.

Mobile & performance:

Mobile wasn’t treated as an afterthought. Layouts, spacing, and text sizes were adjusted so the page still feels balanced on smaller screens.

Performance was also kept in mind. Important content shows up first, and heavier visuals are limited so the page feels smooth and stable when it loads.
